###Get rid of "Overlay Popups" that **trying to force you to like and/or follow social network pages and accounts.**
#####*Sorry, this filter mainly to target sites in Thailand, again.

This filter made to help people get rid of overlay popups *(dimmer, timer, lightbox, colorbox,...)* that trying to force users who browse the web to like Facebook pages or follow social network accounts. *(Twitter, Google+, LINE@, etc.)*<br />
This keep you enjoying to read articles from websites without getting interrupted.<br />
Here's an example, when you enter some sites (mostly clickbait news) you will see something [like this!](http://upic.me/show/57674495)<br />
You can combine with [Fanboy's filter](https://fanboy.co.nz) (Third-party social blocking list and/or Fanboy ultimate list), but it's better to use with my filter because it will remove overlay box that still remaining while social network widgets has been unloaded.<br />
